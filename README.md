# @nokori/js-sdk

Official JavaScript SDK for [nokori](https://nokori.com).

nokori is the Programmable Intelligence platform providing the tools and infrastructure innovators need to move at the speed of imagination.

## The basics

For a full run-down of the nokori platform, check out the [documentation](https://docs.nokori.com).

### Hubs Powered Components

nokori makes it near effortless to add any database or API operation to your components without servers, APIs, or infrastructure to manage.

Because nokori is cloud-native, queries are managed centrally as Special Purpose Cloud Functionsâ„¢ in the nokori UI. T

his uniquely allows you to keep your data operations close to your template logic without sacrificing code maintainability or reusability.

#### Basic Component Example

```js
import nokori from '@nokori/js-sdk'
const nk = nokori('api_key')

async function create(formData: FormData){
 const { data, error } = await nk.query.execute({
    queryId: 'nk.q.-ddqHfqeZNihbChcAbf', //Global Cloud Query ID
      context: {
        name: formData.get('name')
      } 
    }
  )
}

export default function FormComponent() {
  return (
    <form action={create}>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Installation

```bash
npm i @nokori/js-sdk
```

### Usage

Import and initialize the SDK.

```js
import nokori from "@nokori/js-sdk";
const nk = new nokori('<<API_KEY>>')
```

### Querying

Query a database after setting it up in the [nokori App](https://app.nokori.com).

```js
const {data, error} = await nk.query.execute({
  queryId: 'nk.q.-ddqHfqeZNihbChcAbf',
  context: {
    created_at: '2023-01-01',
  } 
})
```

## nokori AI

nokori AI is state of the art that is easy to use and simple to integrate.

We're helping organizations of all sizes integrate common data flows and usecases and rapidly turn them in to AI powered intelligence embeddable in any application.

### Basic AI Example

As seen in our [full docs](https://docs.nokori.com/guides/generate/), a common problem of current Large Language Models (LLM) is the tendency to 'hallucinate' or generate text that is not relevant to the prompt.

Using nokori Generate, you can leverage the results of Hubs Queries to generate text that is relevant to your data and create a more natural experience for your users with accurate information.

As shown above, lets assume this Special Purpose Cloud Function returns the sum of sales since the beginning of the year.

```js
const { data: totalSales, error } = await nk.query.execute({
  queryId: 'nk.q.-ddqHfqeZNihbChcAbf',
  context: {
    created_at: '2022-01-01',
    status: 'active'
  } 
})

// totalSales = { value: 35933 }
```

Next, we can pass these results in generate to create a human-like response from this data for our users.

```js
const { data, error } = await nk.ai.generate({
  prompt: "What are total sales since the beginning of the year?",
  context: [totalSales]
})

// "Total sales are $35,933.00 since Jan 1, 2022."
```

The same example could be leveraged for organizations that had a large document corpus in an ElasticSearch index, for example, allowing their existing ES queries to fetch relevant documents and then generate a human-like response to the user based on those docs.
